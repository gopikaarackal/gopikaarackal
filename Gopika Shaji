- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Gopika Shaji
 Iâ€™m interested in Data Analysis and to Play with programming and visualization tools to uncover patterns and derive conclusions.
 Iâ€™m currently Pursuing a PG Diploma in Data Analysis at Durham College,Oshawa,Canada
 I completed graduation in Mathematics with a CGPA of 8.99 and Masters in Statistics with a CGPA of 7.75.After completing masters, I found that I enjoy studying different concepts in Statistics and working with programming tools.So I joined my current course to update my current skills and to pursue a good career in the field of Data Analysis.
As part of my academic projects, I did two projects on Tranmuted Inverse Lindley Distribution and Semigroups. Also during my masters, I attended a certificate programme on Statistical Governance and Data Analytics which is organized by Department of Statistics,Pondicherry University.
Through this course, I learned about Python and R Programming to perform data analysis and used Power BI to create various dashborads and plots to find patterns.
As I do not have any prior experience in this field, I look forward to collaborating with teams and organizations to acquire the professional knowledge in data analysis.I really like to develop various machine learning models.However I want to work on some practical projects to gain more knowledge and experience in the field.
